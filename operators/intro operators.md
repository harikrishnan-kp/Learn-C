# Operators in C
* Operators are symbols that represent operations to be performed on one or more operands.
* The values or variables on which the operators perform it's operation is called operands.
* An operator in C can be defined as the symbol that helps us to perform some specific mathematical, relational, bitwise, conditional, or logical computations on values and variables
 
```bash
Eg:
    Consider an expression,
                         a = X+Y;

# Here variables X and Y are the operands in which data need to be manipulated is stored and "+" ,"=" symbols are operators
```

* Arithmetic operator
