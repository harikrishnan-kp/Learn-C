## Keywords
Keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings in C. These cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc). Keywords define the structure and behavior of the program. as c is case sensitive all keywords should be written in lower case letters,otherwise compiler will show an error.

There are 32 standard keywords in C, they are

|        |          |          |        |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| auto   | break    | case     | char   |
| const  | continue | default  | do     |
| double | else     | enum     | extern |
| float  | for      | goto     | if     |
| int    | long     | register | return |
| short  | signed   | sizeof   | static |
| struct | switch   | typedef  | union  |
| void   | unsigned | volatile | while  |

```bash
# Note: The number of keywords may change depending on the version of C you are using. For example, keywords present in ANSI C are 32 while in C11, it was increased to 44. Moreover, in the latest c23, it is increased to around 54.
